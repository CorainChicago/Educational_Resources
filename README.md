# Educational_Resources

This is where I store educational resources when I run across them.  I might not have tried the resources out so while I can't personally recommend them, I know plenty of smart and nice people in tech so I'm rather confident that they are at least good and not outdated.  Please don't be shy about contributing to the list, but do be shy about being rude.
